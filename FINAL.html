The security forces responded by firing upon them. This caused the unrest to spread to nearby cities. By the summer, the Syrian regime was using tanks to bombard restive cities. Outside powers, including the EU and the Arab League, responded by imposing strict sanctions on Damascus.",
				"Violence continues to bubble in many cities around Syria. The international community struggles to form a united response: while many Western countries recall their embassadors in response to the ongoing brutal crackdown by security forces, Russia continued to support Asad's regime in the security council and purportedly also continued to send weaponry to Damascus. Meanwhile, in November opposition forces proclaim the formation of a National Coalition, which excludes Islamist militias. This is recognised by many outside countries as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people a month later.",
				"2013 saw an increased role for Islamists in the Syrian war. The rebels saw some significant reverses, which they put down to an unwillingness of outside countries to arm them due to the presence of Islamists in their midst. In the North, Kurdish forces battle various Arab forces (including both the regime and Jabhat al-Nusra) to take control of Ras al-Ayn. The Islamist rebels start to gradually take territory from the Western-backed Free Syrian Army. Meanwhile, Syria agrees to allow international inspectors in to begin destroying its stockpiles of chemical weapons.",
				"In January, peace talks fail due to the inability to come to an agreement over what a post-war Syrian government would look like. The city of Homs falls to government forces after 3 years of resistance. The UN confirms that it has finished the task of destroying Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. The biggest story of the year, however, is the entry of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) into the Syrian theatre. They take a large amount of territory in a very short timeframe, including the key city of Raqqa, and declare a 'caliphate' in August of 2014. The US responds by launching air-strikes against ISIS-held positions.",
				"Fighting intensifies between Kurdish troops and ISIS. ISIS capture the historical site of Palmyra, and proceed to destroy some of the priceless monuments there. Russia starts carrying out airstrikes. Though it claims to be acting against ISIS, outside observers claim that it is often targetting anti-Asad rebels. Britain also wades into the fray, carrying out airstrikes in support of the US mission.",
				"In January, a US-Russian-brokered partial ceasefire comes into effect. It holds, but it does not include ISIS, so many areas of the country remain violent. In March, Syrian forces retake Palmyra with Russian assistance. The damage to the monuments there is not as bad as had initially been feared."

Despite being nominally secular, analysts contend that the regime exploits sectarian tensions to remain in power. Asad himself is from the minority Alawite sect, and relies heavily on support from the Alawite community to govern. Bashar al-Asad is the son of the former president Hafez al-Asad, and took power upon the latter's death in the year 2000. The Syrian Army consists of some 125,000 active personnel." },

The YPG is primarily Kurdish, but it also recruits Arabs, Turks, and Westerners. There are Assyrian/Syriac Christian units integrated into its command structure. The YPG considers itself a democratic people's army and conducts internal elections as a method of appointing officers. The YPG has shown itself to be one of the most militarily effective of the pro-Western Syrian rebels."},

Though it was once widely popular in the Arab world as it was seen as a resistance movement against Israel, this image has been tarnished by its intervention in the Syrian conflict on the side of its co-religionists in the Syrian government, which has dealt a serious blow to its cross-sectarian appeal."},

It has been actively attempting to unite all the Islamist opposition to Asad under one banner. It routinely cooperates with Jabhat al-Nusra, and initially also ISIS, though relationships with the latter soured after claims that ISIS had assassinated a key member of Ahrar al-Sham. While it does aim to establish a state run by Shariah law, it is seen as more moderate than ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra."},
									{ name: "Jabhat al-Nusra", col: "green", posx: positions.jabhat[0], posy: positions.jabhat[1], size: sizes.jabhat[state], info: "Jabhat al-Nusra began to rise to prominence among rebel organizations in Syria for its reliable supply of arms, funding, and fighters that came from a combination of foreign donors and the Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda. Considered well trained, professional, and relatively successful on the battlefield, al-Nusra earned the respect and support of many rebel groups, including many moderate-leaning groups, early in the war. However, although it has avoided tactics like the brutal executions and sectarian attacks that made AQI unpopular, al-Nusra engendered opposition among some Syrians at the beginning of the conflict by imposing religious laws in areas it controlled. "},

It is the result of the merger of about fifty Damascus-based Islamist opposition groups. Although it is clear that Jaish al-Islam has had a significant impact in the war, particularly in Damascus, little verifiable reporting is available on the group."},

Adept at social media, ISIL became notorious for its videos of beheadings of both soldiers and civilians, including journalists and aid workers, and for the destruction of cultural heritage sites. The United Nations holds ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, and Amnesty International has charged the group with ethnic cleansing on a 'historic scale' in northern Iraq."},

It is a staunch ally of Bashar al-Asad, and has repeatedly handicapped attempts to build a united international position against his regime at the United Nations. It is widely accepted that the future of Syria will not be decided without Russian involvement." }
